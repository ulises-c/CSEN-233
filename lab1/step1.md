Step 1: Run each of the following basic networking commands in Linux and write your observations:

1. netstat: displays the contents of network interfaces; with the – a option, the command displays the state of all active sockets (more to come on sockets as endpoints of communication). With the – r option, the routing table is displayed. Please type man netstat to learn about all options.
2. ifconfig: configures network interface parameters. With the – a option, the state of all interfaces is displayed. Other options are also used to assign a new IP address to an interface, assign a new network mask for an interface, disable an interface, and more. Please type man ifconfig to learn about all options.
3. hostname: displays and sets the hostname of the system. Please type man hostname to learn about all options.
4. ping: sends ECHO_REQUEST datagram to a network host using ICMP protocol to elicit an ECHO_RESPONSE from the host or gateway. Please type man ping to learn about all options.
5. traceroute: displays the route packets trace to a network host using IP protocol “time to live”. Please type man traceroute to learn about all options.
6. telnet: remote connection to the server at a specific port (mainly 80 – http port)
7. host/dig: performs DNS lookups.
8. route: manipulates network routing tables.
9. arp: displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation tables used by the address resolution protocol.

For each command:

- Summarize the output generated by the command.
- Explain the purpose and functionality of the command.
- Describe scenarios where the command would be useful in networking tasks.

Example: Command: ping google.com

- The command sends ICMP packets to google.com (server) and receive ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
- The output shows the round-trip time, packet loss percentage, and total time.
- ping is generally used to test the reachability of a host on a network and measure the time it takes for packets to travel to the host and come back. Network administrators use ping to troubleshoot connectivity issues, check network latency, and verify the status of a remote server.

1. `netstat`: Establishes a connection with everything on the same local area network, there are many devices on the network so it took a while to complete this. Shows protocol, Recv-Q, Send-Q, Local Address, Foreign Address, and State. This could be nice to SSH to a machine or to check how many devices are on the network.
2. `ifconfig`: Shows all active network interfaces on your machine, their IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6), subnet masks, MAC addresses, and transmitted/received packet stats. Displays network interface information. Useful for checking local IP address and debugging connection issues.
3. `hostname`: Displays the system’s current hostname (for me ulises-ubuntu). Gets the hostname of the system. Useful for checking the name of the system and it can be used to ssh or host something locally and type that into the URL instead of an IP address.
4. `ping google.com`: Sends packets to a host and returns them to client giving a round trip time, packet loss, and TTL. Useful for testing connections between host and client. Used in testing a server or local devices, or to test packet loss.
5. `traceroute google.com`:Checks all the links in between client and server/host. Purpose is to map the path the packets take to reach the server/host. Used to find out where packets are going and to understand network route.
6. `telnet google.com 80`: Checks the port status at a certain IP address. Used to test port connectivity. Used to check if a service is working on a specific port and to check firewall status.
7. `host google.com`: Shows IP address, IPv6 address, and mail port. Useful for checking address and ports. Good for diagnosing ports and services.
8. `dig google.com`: Provides DNS query information. This shows how DNS resolves URL into IP address. Useful for checking DNS resolution and configuarion.
9. `route`: Displays the routing table with destination networks, gateway addresses, interfaces, and metrics. Shows or modifies the network routing table, which dictates where packets are sent based on destination IP. Useful for determining the default gateway and routing path.
10. `arp`: Lists the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table, showing IP addresses mapped to MAC addresses of devices on the local network. Used to map IP address to MAC address. Useful for identifying devices on the the LAN and checking network issues.
